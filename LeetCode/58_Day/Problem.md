# [3548. Equal Sum Grid Partition II](https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-sum-grid-partition-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-03-24)

**Difficulty:** Hard

## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:

1. Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
2. The sum of elements in both sections is equal, or can be made equal by discounting at most one single cell in total (from either section).
3. If a cell is discounted, the rest of the section must remain connected.

Return `true` if such a partition exists; otherwise, return `false`.

**Note:** A section is connected if every cell in it can be reached from any other cell by moving up, down, left, or right through other cells in the section.

## Constraints

* `1 <= m == grid.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 10^5`
* `2 <= m * n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5`
