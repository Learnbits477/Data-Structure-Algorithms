# [2075. Decode the Slanted Ciphertext](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-the-slanted-ciphertext/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-03-25)

## Problem Description
A string `originalText` is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string `encodedText` with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows `rows`.

`originalText` is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner. The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of `originalText`. All empty cells are filled with `' '`. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in `originalText`.

`encodedText` is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion. The characters in the blue cells are appended first to `encodedText`, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. 

Given the encoded string `encodedText` and number of rows `rows`, return the original string `originalText`.

**Note:** `originalText` does not have any trailing spaces `' '`. The test cases are generated such that there is only one possible `originalText`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: encodedText = "ch   ie   pr", rows = 3
Output: "cipher"
Explanation: This is the same example described in the problem description.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: encodedText = "iveo    eed   l te   olc", rows = 4
Output: "i love leetcode"
Explanation: The figure above denotes the matrix that was used to encode originalText. 
The blue arrows show how we can find originalText from encodedText.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: encodedText = "coding", rows = 1
Output: "coding"
Explanation: Since there is only 1 row, both originalText and encodedText are the same.
```

## Constraints
- `0 <= encodedText.length <= 10^6`
- `encodedText` consists of lowercase English letters and `' '` only.
- `encodedText` is a valid encoding of some `originalText` that does not have trailing spaces.
- `1 <= rows <= 1000`
- The testcases are generated such that there is only one possible `originalText`.
