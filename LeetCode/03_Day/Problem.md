## Description

You are given two 0-indexed strings `source` and `target`, both of length `n` and consisting of lowercase English characters. You are also given two 0-indexed string arrays `original` and `changed`, and an integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` represents the cost of converting the string `original[i]` to the string `changed[i]`.

You start with the string `source`. In one operation, you can pick a substring `x` from the string, and change it to `y` at a cost of `z` if there exists any index `j` such that `cost[j] == z`, `original[j] == x`, and `changed[j] == y`. You are allowed to do any number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy either of these two conditions:

1. The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with either `b < c` or `d < a`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are disjoint.
2. The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with `a == c` and `b == d`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are identical.

Return the _minimum cost_ to convert the string `source` to the string `target` using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert `source` to `target`, return `-1`.

**Note** that there may exist indices `i`, `j` such that `original[j] == original[i]` and `changed[j] == changed[i]`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input**: `source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]`  
**Output**: `28`  
**Explanation**: To convert "abcd" to "acbe", do the following operations:

- Change substring `source[1..1]` from "b" to "c" at a cost of 5.
- Change substring `source[2..2]` from "c" to "e" at a cost of 1.
- Change substring `source[2..2]` from "e" to "b" at a cost of 2.
- Change substring `source[3..3]` from "d" to "e" at a cost of 20.
  The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.  
  It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `source = "abcdefgh", target = "acdeeghh", original = ["bcd","fgh","thh"], changed = ["cde","thh","ghh"], cost = [1,3,5]`  
**Output**: `9`  
**Explanation**: To convert "abcdefgh" to "acdeeghh", do the following operations:

- Change substring `source[1..3]` from "bcd" to "cde" at a cost of 1.
- Change substring `source[5..7]` from "fgh" to "thh" at a cost of 3.
- Change substring `source[5..7]` from "thh" to "ghh" at a cost of 5.
  The total cost incurred is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
  It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.

### Example 3:

**Input**: `source = "abcdefgh", target = "addddddd", original = ["bcd","defgh"], changed = ["ddd","ddddd"], cost = [100,1578]`  
**Output**: `-1`  
**Explanation**: It is impossible to convert "abcdefgh" to "addddddd".
