## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr[]` representing non-negative integers, arrange them so that after concatenating all of them in order, it results in the **largest possible number**. Since the result may be very large, return it as a string.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  arr[] = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
Output: 9534330
Explanation: The arrangement [9, 5, 34, 3, 30] gives the largest value.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  arr[] = [54, 546, 548, 60]
Output: 6054854654
Explanation: The arrangement [60, 548, 546, 54] gives the largest value.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:  arr[] = [3, 4, 6, 5, 9]
Output: 96543
Explanation: The arrangement [9, 6, 5, 4, 3] gives the largest value.
```

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`
